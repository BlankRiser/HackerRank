# HackerRank

Here is where you find my solutions to HackerRank problems. They might not be the most efficient, but they do get the job done. This repo here is for me to come back to these solutions and find a strategy to make the better.

I will mostly solve problems using Python and Typescript, but will add SQL solutions too(don't want to get rusty at SQL even though my current job profile does not require me to use it.)
